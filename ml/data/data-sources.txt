# guiding questions: what's the data? and how do we get it?
- natural vegetation -> global cropland map, configure with open street map api to do geolocation by district. Districts defined as: as parsimonious as possible. 
- population growth
- wealth inequality
- income inequality
- is it possible to plot grocery stores or communal farmland by district also? google maps requests? - max will do this
- level of conflict -- can do manually, probably, lmao
- development index -- definitely exists at the country level, can probably just use this and disseminate it by district
- gini coefficient
- regime type? democracy, autocracy, etc. White hot encode it.
- migration -- max doing also
- climate (temp, humidity, precipitation)
- extreme weather
- urbanization
- gender inequality index
- nutritional deficiency https://platform.who.int/mortality/themes/theme-details/topics/topic-details/MDB/nutritional-deficiencies
